# Vue Quiz

This was built as a project for [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc.org/) Learn Vue Course.  I also fixed some minor bugs with the finished project.

## Bugs Fixed
- The app would index past the number of questions fetched from the API.
- HTML special entities weren't being parsed from the fetched questions.
- No way to start the quiz over once all 10 questions were finished.
- Next button was still active after all 10 questions were finished
